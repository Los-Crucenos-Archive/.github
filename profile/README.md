# History

Los Cruceños was founded by Antonio “Tony” Ledesma Fresquez and Onesino “Necho” Duran, Mexican musicians whose voice and compositions resonated in their community for decades. 
Their music captured the essence of an era, preserving stories, and the spirit of New Mexico and it’s people.  

Today, I have the honor of preserving and sharing these recordings, ensuring that their art and legacy continue to inspire future generations.
